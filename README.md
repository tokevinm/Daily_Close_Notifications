Generates daily email notifications for various digital assets at daily close (00:00) UTC. First version is centered around bitcoin/crypto.

Users subscribe via Google Form (not currently public), and user data is accessed via the Sheety API. Users are given options as to which digital assets they would like to be notified about.
Cryptocurrency data is accessed via the CoinGecko API

Returns price, % change, market cap, and total market cap.

Functionalities to be added:
Special notifications on daily closes that hold more weight i.e. Weekly, Monthly.
Additional usage of a stock market API to utilize data on main indices, and so users can compare/contrast price changes between asset classes and correlations/divergences.
Addition of more functions to clean up code of repetition.



This is my first personal project with the goals of generating all code/ideas myself and completing the first rendition before a month of beginning my coding journey. 
Content with how it works, may improve upon it with more intermediate techniques in the future i.e. incorporate a hash map to simulate a significantly larger userbase.
