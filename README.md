Generates daily email notifications for various digital assets at daily close (00:00) UTC. First version is centered around bitcoin/crypto.

Users subscribe via Google Form (not currently public), and user data is accessed via the Sheety API (https://sheety.co). Users are given options as to which digital assets they would like to be notified about.
Cryptocurrency data is accessed via the CoinGecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).

Returns price, % change, market cap, and total market cap.

Service is automated via python anywhere (https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

Functionalities to be added:
- Special notifications for daily closes that hold more weight i.e. Weekly, Monthly.
- Additional usage of a stock market API to utilize data on main indices, and so users can compare/contrast price changes between asset classes and correlations/divergences.
- Addition of more functions to clean code of repetition.
- Inspirational Quotes? (haha)
- Possibly more intermediate techniques in the future i.e. incorporate a hash map to simulate a significantly larger userbase.



This is my first personal project with the goals of generating all code/ideas myself and completing the first rendition before a month of beginning my coding journey.
